<h2>Tutorial (3/3)</h2>
<p>If you are the Receiver you will have two choices after the Sender has sent some of their money to you: Cooperate or Defect.</p>
<p>If the Receiver cooperates, then they will lose some of the money they received from the Sender, but the Sender will receive double the amount of money that they originally sent to the Receiver. However, if the Receiver defects, then the Receiver will keep all the money that the Sender originally sent, but the Sender will lose that money.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you will be paired up with multiple different people over the course of this study, and they will be able to know whether you Cooperated or Defected in previous rounds -- though they will not know how much you sent as a Sender, or how much you returned as a Receiver.</p>
