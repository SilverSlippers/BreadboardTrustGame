<p>If you are the Sender you will decide how much of your starting sum of money (which is {1} cents) to send to your partner (i.e. the Receiver). You may choose to send any amount between {0} and {1} cents.</p>
<p>Your partner will then be given the option to double and return the money you sent, though at some cost to them. If they choose to cooperate and bear a cost, you will receive double the amount of money you originally sent. However, if they choose not to cooperate, you will not receive any money, and the money that you originally sent will be lost.</p>
